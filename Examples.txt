So you want to edit Peregrine, huh?

Well, first things first, everything you do goes through me.  Yes, me.  No, not the voice in your head, me, Atreus.  I approve every edit to this bot before it goes live.

That being said, I'm fairly lenient.  I'd probably ask you to edit it a certain way instead of outright deleting it.
